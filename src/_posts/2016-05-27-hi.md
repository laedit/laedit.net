Hi,

This is my personal blog.  
I wanted to make a multilingual blog with [Pretzel](http://code52.org/pretzel/) but right now the project need some modification to to that.  
So basically this is still a WIP for now...  
Meanwhile I will be discovering the limits and possibilities of Pretzel, and integrate it with [AppVeyor](http://www.appveyor.com).

There is no comments for now but you can contact me through [twitter](https://twitter.com/laedit) or [mail](mailto:contact@laedit.net).

#### What is Pretzel
Pretzel is a static website generator, like [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com) but in .net.


#### What is AppVeyor
AppVeyor is a Continuous Integration and Deployment service backed by Windows Azure, like [Travis](https://travis-ci.org/) but for Windows environments.
